# Canvas-Calendar

## For <ins>UF</ins> students who are taking additional classes at <ins>SFC</ins>, it may be tedious to log in to multiple Canvas instances to view assignments that may be due. <br> <br>This software polls both accounts, compiles a list of due assignments, sorts them by due date/time, and returns them.

#### At some point, this code will be added to an API and used by the front-end of a webapp to render a calendar with all assignments.
