#Canvas-Calendar

At some point, this code will be added to an API designed to provide a list of student's assignments from both the Univeristy of Florida and Santa Fe College.
For students who are taking additional classes at SFC, it may be tedious to log in to multiple Canvas instances to view assignments that may be due.
This software polls both accounts, compiles a list of due assignments, sorts them by due date/time, and returns them.
